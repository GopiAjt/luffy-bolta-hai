Dialogue: 0,0:00,0:01,Default,,0,0,0,,The Straw Hats are closing in on Laugh Tale, but is the One Piece really just treasure?  I have a theory!  Remember the ancient weapons, Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus?  What if the One Piece isn't gold and jewels, but the *key* to awakening these weapons?!  Imagine: Luffy, wielding the power of Poseidon, a sea king's might under his command!  Zoro, mastering the legendary Pluton, its destructive force channeled through his blades!  And Uranus?  Its power remains a mystery… a celestial force waiting to be unleashed! The World Government fears this ultimate power, hidden not in a chest, but in the very history of the Void Century! This ancient knowledge, this is the REAL One Piece!  But that’s not all… what if the awakening of these weapons triggers something far greater?  What do you think?
